![Zimera School](/images/services/school.jpg)

Our school helps in talent or human resources development. Basically, we have some schools which only act as themes grouping. Our schools consist of:

1. School of Decentralized Systems
2. School of Enterprise Systems
3. School of Software Engineering
4. School of Data

Prior to enter Zimera School, a learner needs to understand the basic. It is not that difficult, but you may need to change your paradigm in learning by consistently challenged your ability to solve problems. Head over to our [GitHub repo for basic skills](https://github.com/zimera-school/materi-pembelajaran/blob/main/kemampuan-dasar.md).

## School of Decentralized Systems

A decentralized system is a system which consists of many nodes with control and decision making are not centralized in only one node. A blockchain system is an example of a decentralized system. In this school, we put our effort in human resources knowledge improvement towards decentralized system. Practically, although decentralized systems is the superclass of blockchain, people usually more interested in blockchain. In this regard, we concentrate on three kinds of blockchain system:

1. Public blockchain, such as [Near](https://near.org), [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/), and many others.
2. Private and permissioned blockchain, such as [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric)
3. Consortium / Enterprise blockchain, such as [Corda](https://corda.net/), [Quorum](https://consensys.net/quorum/)
