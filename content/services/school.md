# About the School

![Zimera School](/images/services/school.jpg)

Our school helps in talent or human resources development. Basically, we have some schools which only act as themes grouping. Our schools consist of:

1. School of Decentralized Systems
2. School of Enterprise Systems
3. School of Software Engineering
4. School of Data

Prior to enter Zimera School, a learner needs to understand the basic. It is not that difficult, but one may need to his/her paradigm in learning by consistently challenged his/her ability to solve problems. Head over to our [GitHub repo for basic skills](https://github.com/zimera-school/materi-pembelajaran/blob/main/kemampuan-dasar.md) to learn more about this basic ability.

## School of Decentralized Systems

A decentralized system is a system which consists of many nodes with control and decision making are not centralized in only one node. A blockchain system is an example of a decentralized system. In this school, we put our effort in human resources knowledge improvement towards decentralized system. Practically, although decentralized systems is the superclass of blockchain, people usually more interested in blockchain. In this regard, we concentrate on three kinds of blockchain system:

1. Public blockchain, such as [Near](https://near.org), [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/), and many others.
2. Private and permissioned blockchain, such as [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric)
3. Consortium / Enterprise blockchain, such as [Corda](https://corda.net/), [Quorum](https://consensys.net/quorum/)

## School of Enterprise Systems

An enterprise is usually used to denotes a business organization which has complex management and its size is big (could be located in more than one physical location with many human resurces). In this context, we do not limit our topic just for business / for profit organization. Any (big) organization will do. In this school, we focus our topic on any big oganization. As there are many departments involve in dailty activities of an enterprise entity, there are some information systems which are used by an enterprise entity, for example, we can have CRM (*Customer Relationship Managemen*), SCM (*Supply Chain Management*), Accounting System, and ERP (*Enterprise Resource Planning*). 

## School of Software Engineering

A software is a part of information technology. Engineering a software is proved to be difficult since we need to take care of techinical as well as non technical things in the process. This school focus on how to engineer a software. This could be any type of software, eventhough we will focus only on non hardware-related software engineering. From software development methodology (such as Agile Software Development - eXtreme Programming, Lean Software Development, Disciplined Agile, etc), until programming techniques become the focus of this school.

## School of Data

Data can be used for many useful things. Without data, an organization usually depends on their intuition only. Using data, an organization may has an insight which is needed to improve management in managing their organization. We specifically focus on many data model (structured - SQL and NoSQL). Our range of topics include:

1. Data Engineering
2. Data Analysis
3. Data Science
