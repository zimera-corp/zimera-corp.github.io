Systems services provide data-related software products. We do not provide services for project-based software systems, instead we engineer some products (in some cases, we also fork some open source software products) and provide services for customization of the software. In case of providing software customization for some open source projects, we will put all of our modification to upstream and so that the software is the same with upstream version. This case happen in source code level version, so that one can be sure that we do not offer other version. We will, of course, make some documentation about differences with upstream.

## Zimera ERP

Zimera ERP is a customized instance of [Tryton](https://tryton.org). We provide Zimera ERP with the same license and copyright with Tryton. You may visit [Zimera ERP repo](https://github.com/zimera-systems/zimera-erp) for more information as to why we decide to create our own Zimera ERP and how Zimera ERP is different with Tryton (although at source code level, Zimera ERP is still the same with Tryton).
