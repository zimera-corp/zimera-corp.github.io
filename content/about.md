Zimera Corporation was founded on February 14th, 2022 under the name of PT Zenit Merdeka Raya. The name **Zimera** has a simple meaning, taking from African language: *one that creates*. This name becomes the underlying philosophy of Zimera Operation: **to create**. In a broader sense, we do really appreciate anybody who creates something. It is not limited to just create a software per se, but also other things: create a better SOP (Standard Operating Procedure), create a solution to a problem not related with software creation, etc. This is why we want to emphasize **maker culture** in our organization.

As a software and data technologies company, our reason of existence (a.k.a *mission*) is to provide some services in software and data technologies. For more information, please see our [services](/services)
