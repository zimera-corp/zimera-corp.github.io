      <description>Our consulting services assist businesses or any other organizations with anything related to data and software. We focus on client&amp;rsquo;s critical issues and persistently work to achieve goals. Therefore, it is very important to define the problem since the beginning and stick to it until the solution has been succesfully completed. Specifically, there&amp;rsquo;s Powel&amp;rsquo;s Three C&amp;rsquo;s: Clarity, Consistency, and Commitment as our main concerns in every task/project.
We assist in problem solving.</description>

      <description>Systems services provide data-related software products. We do not provide services for project-based software systems, instead we engineer some products (in some cases, we also fork some open source software products) and provide services for customization of the software. In case of providing software customization for some open source projects, we will put all of our modification to upstream and so that the software is the same with upstream version.</description>
