      <description>As a long time PostgreSQL user, it&amp;rsquo;s normal that YugabyteDB got my attention. It&amp;rsquo;s a distributed SQL database which features-compatible with PostgreSQL so that I don&amp;rsquo;t need to lose my investation. YugabyteDB reuses PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s query layer, so I can use my development tools as usual. It gives me more since there is also Cassandra query layer. Using YugabyteDB I can reuse my SQL skill and development tools, enhanced with NOSQL data model (especially wide-column store), while I have NewSQL&amp;rsquo;s resiliency, scalability, and high performance.</description>

      <description>Managing a software development team is never an easy task. It consists of 2 sides:

In this article, I will ouline some of my experiences in managing a software development team. This list is not meant to be complete nor perfect.

      <description>If you ever being in a team which practices agile software development, you might already heard about how a software development team &amp;ldquo;welcome chnging requirements&amp;rdquo;. While it sounds great, I personally think, if this statement is not properly explained, the impact will be negative on the development team side. Now, let&amp;rsquo;s see the complete statement:
Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.</description>

      <description>So you are interested in software development and want to become one who do that job. Initially you think that it’s only a matter of coding. creating source code, have them compiled, and then deploy the software for the customer/client. Later on, you realize that developing software is hard. Even harder since so many things beyond technical issues are also involved. Suddenly you realize that what you have learned in school is not enough.</description>
